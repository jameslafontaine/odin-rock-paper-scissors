# Rock Paper Scissors

A basic Rock Paper Scissors game developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations section. This project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript skills, including conditionals, loops, functions, and user interaction via the console.

- **[2024-11-04]** - Updated to have basic GUI using DOM manipulation and event handlers.

## Project Description

This console-based game allows the player to compete against the computer in a game of Rock Paper Scissors. The game showcases the use of JavaScript to implement logic and control flow, allowing for interactive gameplay in the console.

## Features

-   **Player vs Computer Gameplay**: The player selects an option (rock, paper, or scissors), while the computer randomly chooses its own.
-   **Round Results**: Each round is evaluated, and the winner is determined based on standard Rock Paper Scissors rules.
-   **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores.
-   **Game Outcome**: After a series of rounds, the overall winner is declared.

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

-   **JavaScript Conditionals**: Using `if` statements and logical operators to evaluate choices and determine the winner.
-   **Functions**: Writing functions to handle gameplay logic, player/computer choices, and result display.
-   **Loops**: Using loops to run multiple rounds and track scores.
-   **Basic Console Interaction**: Accepting user input and displaying outputs in the browser console.

## How to Play

1. Open the browser's Developer Console (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J`) to see game progress.
2. The game will prompt you to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
3. The computer will make a random choice, and the winner of the round will be displayed.
4. After a set number of rounds, the final winner is declared.

## Some Future Improvements

- [x] Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually interactive.
- [ ] Implementing additional rounds or difficulty levels.
- [ ] Enhancing user experience with sound effects and animations for winning rounds.
